A good guide for inexperienced users must conform to basic pragmatic rules. Pragmatics is a subfield of linguistics that evaluates how human language is utilized in social interactions.[^1]
One prevalent theory in pragmatics is Relevance Theory. Relevance theory implies the following two things about the goals of human communication[^2]:
Every utterance (sentence) should be:
 a. relevant enough for it to be worth the addressee's effort to process it. (If the utterance contained too
 few positive cognitive effects for the addressee in relation to the processing effort needed to achieve
 these effects, she wouldn't bother processing it, and the communicator needn't have taken the trouble to
 utter it.)
 b. the most relevant one compatible with the communicator's abilities and preferences. (Otherwise the
 communicator would have chosen a more relevant utterance – e.g. one that needs less processing effort
 and/or achieves more positive cognitive effects on part of the addressee – to convey her meaning. After
 all, she wants to be understood as easily and reliably as possible.)
 
These two rules are all a good communicator needs to remember when writing technical guides. You must
evaluate the lowest level of experience for your audience, and not the average level of experience, and
build all documentation from there. Examples of using these principles in documentation include:
- Citing goals and expected experience levels explicitly at the beginning of technical documentation. 
- Allowing hyperlinks to link to more advanced articles, but ensuring the document is functionally complete without them
- Poviding an example project or code sample that utilizes advanced features, or at the very least a combination of the simple features a library or function provides
- Diagramming of all complex concepts
- Providing links to a website containing updates including changelogs, bugfixes, and other updates so that your audience can alert your staff to product issues

And that's it! Stick to these principles and remember to _say less_
